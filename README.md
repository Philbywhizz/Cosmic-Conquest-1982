# Cosmic Conquest 1982

This is a re-creation of a [realtime strategy game published in BYTE Magazine in 1982](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1982-12/page/n131/mode/1up?q=cosmic+conquest). It is credited as one of the first realtime strategy computer games.

I am going to try to get it running in GForth on modern hardware.

Wish me luck.

# Goals

I have two goals:

1. Create a human-verified reference copy of the original source code.
2. If possible, modify the original source code so that it can run on a modern, standards compliant Forth (I am currently targetting GForth).

# How to Help

If you would like to help, please reach out to me on Reddit, LinkedIn or Mastodon.

# How to Run

**NOT COMPLETE- WORK IN PROGRESS**

Assuming you have installed `gforth` installed:

```
gforth main.fs
```

I don't have a preferred GForth version yet.
